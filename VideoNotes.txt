*** 411-6-Create React App Overview ***

TIME  START

React has 2 kinds of components
    1. Functional Component 
    2. Class-based Component 

STATE: a memory that KEEPS UP with literally everything we want with our screen

    when you NEED STATE you have to create a CLASS-BASED COMPONENT  

So, create the FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT into a CLASS-BASED COMPONENT  

    NOTE: Class-based components are being phased out of React because they take up more memory, and more processing time 

    They're moving to Functional Components using HOOKS  

You'll usually only have 1 class-based component  


Must USE setState()

To take in a user's input and store it you must:
    1. Create a visual place for the user to input data
    2. Reserve a place to store that data in state 
    3. Create a method to handle the input and store it

3 fundamentals of components:

    state --> 1. What information gets displayed in the UI.  How does this communicate between methods?

    props -->  information that the component receives
